Nothing fancy, just a customizable dashboard to track the health & fitness metrics you care about ðŸ’ª

## Privacy First
Local first - your data is only stored in your browser unless you chose to sync your data with the server. **Your data is always encrypted before it is sent anywhere!**

## Portable
You can always chose to export your data in the form of CSV files.

## Minimal Data Entry
Just track the metrics you care about! As simple as a notepad.
